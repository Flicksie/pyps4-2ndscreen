Usage
=====================
API should be accessed initially like the following examples.

Most functions can be accessed from the high-level PS4 object. You will need to pass in the IP address of your PS4 and your PSN credentials.

There are several async/asyncio coroutine functions in this module. These functions should be accessed with an Asyncio loop.

There are two versions of the Ps4 object/class: Ps4() and Ps4Async(). The Ps4Async version is recommended over the legacy Ps4 version which may be deprecated in the future.
The difference between the two is that the Ps4() class uses synchronous sockets (socket.socket) while the Ps4Async() class uses asyncio transports and protocols. If using the Async version, a running asyncio event loop is required.

Using Ps4Async Example
========================

- First start an asyncio event loop in the main thread.

.. code:: python

    import asyncio

    task = asyncio.ensure_future(YourProgram())
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete()

- Next you need to init the Device Discovery Protocol. This will enable you to get regular status updates.

.. code:: python

    from pyps4_2ndscreen.ddp import async_create_ddp_endpoint

    _, ddp_protocol = await async_create_ddp_endpoint()

- Then you can instantiate the Ps4Async class and assign the ddp_protocol object to the ps4 object.

.. code:: python

    ip_address = '192.168.0.3'
    creds = 'yourcredentials'
    ps4 = Ps4Async(ip_address, creds)
    ps4.ddp_protocol = ddp_protocol


Getting Credentials
=====================

Your PSN Credentials can be generated by running a CLI command or by using the Python interpreter:

Terminal Command:

.. code:: bash

    pyps4-2ndscreen credentials

If your system does not have setcap utilities your may run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    sudo ./bin/pyps4-2ndscreen credentials

or

Python:

.. code:: python

    from pyps4_2ndscreen.credential import Credentials
    creds = Credentials()

    YourCredentials = creds.start()

This will start the credential service and will return the credentials for the PSN Account. You will need to get the PS4 Second Screen app for Android or iOS to do this. Once you have logged in with your acccount in the app and started the service, refresh the devices in the app and select the device named 'pyps4-2ndscreen'.
